# LaTeX-Docs
LaTeX Docs I created for the students in my Precalculus Supplemental Instruction sessions which I facilitate.

.tex files are WIP (work in progress).

LaTeX code originally generated on the free TeXeR online application from the Art of Problem Solving website:

.tex files need to be converted and edited to proper LaTeX format (don't try to run them as .tex files).
